// Turning a font glyph or emoji into a file the shell can actually draw.
//
// A profile icon is allowed to be a Segoe MDL2 glyph or an emoji, and the
// settings model deliberately resolves those to themselves (see
// MediaResourceSupport.h and the ValidateResolverNotCalledForEmojiIcons test).
// XAML renders such a string directly, but a jump list entry cannot: it takes
// either a file containing an icon or a logo URI, and a bare glyph is neither,
// so the entry draws blank. That is not a rare corner -- the DEFAULT profile
// icon is the glyph U+E756 (MTSMSettings.h), so every profile without an
// explicit icon is affected, as is every SSH profile (SshHostGenerator uses
// U+E977).
//
// So rasterize the glyph ourselves and hand the shell a real .ico. This is the
// approach the maintainers suggested in microsoft/terminal#10552 ("we could
// actually download the image locally and set the path for the jumplist entry
// to that file") applied to glyphs rather than to remote images.
