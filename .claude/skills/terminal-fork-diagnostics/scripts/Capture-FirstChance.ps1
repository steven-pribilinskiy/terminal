# Capture a symbol-resolved first-chance stack from the Test slot while a setting
# is changed live.
#
# Why this shape: the failures worth debugging in this app are caught, or land a
# tick later during render, so a dump after the fact carries nothing useful - a
# stowed exception's inner error lives on heap a minidump does not capture. The
# throw has to be caught as it happens, which means a debugger attached before
# the trigger.
#
# The trigger is a settings.json write, because AppLogic watches the settings
# FOLDER and hot-reloads. That needs no keyboard and no pointer, so this runs
# without taking the machine away from anyone.

# Three traps, and the order they matter in:
#
#   40080201  RoOriginateError. This is the one to read FIRST when an HRESULT
#             comes back across an ABI boundary. A C++ throw on our side only
#             shows OUR frames - the callee has already returned - so it says
#             what we were doing and never who refused. The originate fires
#             INSIDE the component that rejected the call, so its stack names
#             the actual objector.
#   e06d7363  a C++ throw.
#   c000027b  the XAML stowed-exception fail-fast.
#
# .exr -1 carries the HRESULT a minidump would have lost.

# NOT .symfix. It REPLACES the symbol path with Microsoft's server, throwing
# away the local PDBs that were just staged - which is how a capture can look
# perfectly healthy and still render every frame of ours as
# TerminalApp!DllGetActivationFactory+<huge offset>. That is the export table
# being guessed at, not symbols. _NT_SYMBOL_PATH is already set correctly by
# this script; append to it rather than clobbering it.
#
# And reload only OUR module. A bare `.reload /f` force-reloads every module in
# the process from the symbol server - two and a half minutes here, long enough
# that the trigger fires before `g` runs and the traps never arm. The capture
# then looks like "no exception happened", which is the most misleading result
# this script can produce.
#
# `lm vm` reports what actually loaded, because a symbol path that validates and
# a PDB that matches are different things.
