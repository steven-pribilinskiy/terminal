      "Close the terminal and the work is gone. Upstream can put the windows, tabs and splits back, and can even repaint what was on screen, but every pane comes back as a fresh shell: the agent you had a two-hour conversation with, the multiplexer holding six sessions, the dev server — all of them are simply not running any more. Restoring the furniture is not the same as restoring the work.",
    how:
      "Shortly before the layout is written out, every pane is asked what it is running right now. Windows panes are read from the process tree, taking the first thing the shell launched — not the deepest, because an agent spawns a child per MCP server and the deepest descendant is one of those. WSL panes cannot be read that way at all, since none of their processes are Windows processes; instead one probe runs inside each distro and matches panes by the WT_SESSION identifier the terminal already puts into every pane's environment. The answer is stored in the same persisted layout the panes are restored from, so it travels with the profile, the working directory and the split geometry. On the next start it is typed into the pane rather than launched as its command line — launching it would make the agent the pane's root process, so the pane would close the moment it exited, instead of leaving you the shell it was actually running in.",

      "Open a pane and start something: a coding agent, or <code>tmux new-session -s demo</code>.",
      "Close the terminal, or kill it outright. Contents are saved on a timer, so an ungraceful end costs you the process but not the history.",

      "Multiplexer-owned processes are skipped on purpose. shefrd, tmux, screen and zellij mark the processes they run, and those belong to the daemon, which restores them itself; resuming them here too would start a second copy of everything inside.",
      "Only agents whose resume syntax is actually known are in the table. Guessing a flag produces a command that fails at restore, which is worse than getting a shell — anything unlisted can still be named in <code>resumeExtraPrograms</code>.",

    upstream:
      "Restoring buffer <em>contents</em> is upstream's (microsoft/terminal#961, implemented in #16598). Restoring the running process is not: they closed that thread with \"restoring the actual state of the running executable might be impossible\" and deliberately stopped at the text. Saving contents periodically rather than only on a clean exit is an open upstream PR (#19805) that has sat since January.",

  "control-pipe": {
    problem:
      "Automating a terminal from outside usually means faking keystrokes at the window that happens to have focus. That breaks the moment focus moves, races anything else typing, and cannot read back what a pane actually printed. Upstream's own automation surface additionally cannot see into a pane running inside WSL.",
    how:
      "Each window serves a named pipe, <code>\\\\.\\pipe\\wt-control-&lt;pid&gt;</code>, speaking newline-delimited JSON. Four operations: <code>ping</code>, <code>list-panes</code>, <code>capture-pane</code> and <code>send-input</code>. The pipe is created with a DACL granting the current user's SID and nothing else, and rejects remote clients. It cannot run commands or change settings — it can only address panes that already exist.",
    steps: [
      "Leave <code>controlPipe</code> on (it is by default), or set it to false to close the pipe entirely.",
      "Find the pipe: it is named after the Terminal process id, so a client can enumerate <code>\\\\.\\pipe\\wt-control-*</code> and talk to every Terminal running.",

      "<code>send-input</code> takes an optional <code>requireContains</code>, re-checked atomically with the write. If the pane's screen no longer contains that string, nothing is written — which is what makes a command typed into the wrong shell impossible when tabs get reordered mid-flight.",

    how:
      "The card is measured against the actual viewport rather than only the configured maximum width, then flipped horizontally as well as vertically when there is no room on the preferred side, and finally clamped on both axes. It also resolves what the link will actually open, which for a WSL pane means turning a POSIX path into the <code>\\\\wsl.localhost\\&lt;distro&gt;</code> path Windows can follow.",

    problem:
      "A path printed inside WSL means nothing to Windows. Click <code>/home/you/notes.md</code> and Windows looks for a folder called <code>home</code> at the root of your system drive, finds nothing, and the click does nothing — even though the file is right there and openable.",
    how:
      "The distro is worked out from the profile's own launch command, so a Debian pane resolves as Debian rather than as whichever distro happens to be the default. A POSIX path is then rewritten to <code>\\\\wsl.localhost\\&lt;distro&gt;\\…</code>, which Windows can open directly. Paths that already make sense to Windows — a drive letter, a UNC path, <code>/mnt/c/…</code> — are left alone, because they resolve without needing to know the distro at all.",
    steps: [
      "In a WSL pane, print a path: <code>ls -d ~/Documents</code>, or anything that emits an absolute path.",
      "Hover it. The card shows the <code>\\\\wsl.localhost\\…</code> path it will actually open.",

  "plain-click": {
    problem:
      "Opening a link meant Ctrl+clicking it, and inside anything using the mouse — tmux, an editor, a TUI — links stopped being clickable at all, because the application had taken the mouse.",
    how:
      "A plain click follows a link. When an application has requested mouse reporting, the click still reaches the application as it must, but a link under the cursor is recognised first, so both behaviours coexist instead of one shutting the other out.",
    steps: [
      "Click any URL in a pane — no modifier.",
      "Start something that captures the mouse, such as <code>tmux</code>, print a URL inside it, and click that too.",

  "slack-links": {
    problem:
      "Tools that emit Slack-style links write them as <code>&lt;https://example.com|the label&gt;</code>. A terminal that doesn't understand that shows the whole thing as literal text, punctuation and all.",
    how:
      "The bracketed form is recognised and rendered as its label, linking to its target — the same text, minus the plumbing.",
    steps: [
      "Print one: <code>printf '&lt;https://example.com|the label&gt;\\n'</code>.",
      "It renders as <em>the label</em>, and clicking it opens the URL.",

  },

  "color-schemes": {
    problem:
      "A terminal that follows the system light/dark setting still had a single colour scheme, so switching the OS to light left you with a dark scheme on a light window — or meant editing settings twice a day.",
    how:
      "<code>colorScheme</code> accepts a pair rather than a single name. The terminal picks whichever matches the current appearance and re-picks when the OS changes, with no restart.",
    steps: [
      "Set a pair in your profile: <code>\"colorScheme\": { \"light\": \"One Half Light\", \"dark\": \"One Half Dark\" }</code>.",

  "defaults": {
    problem:
      "Three small things that go wrong often enough to matter: the mouse wheel changing font size or window opacity when a modifier was still held, being asked whether to close all windows when only one is open, and having no quick way to look up selected text.",
    how:
      "Selected text can be searched with your default engine. The wheel no longer rebinds itself to zoom or opacity. Quitting with a single window open just quits.",

  "icons": {
    problem:
      "A profile icon pointing at an http(s) URL made settings load wait on the network, and a profile using a glyph or emoji icon showed up in the jump list as a blank tile.",
    how:
      "Remote icons are fetched once and cached locally, so later loads never touch the network. Glyph and emoji icons are rasterised into real icon files for the jump list, and refreshed when a new build is deployed.",
  },

  "slot-system": {
    problem:
      "Running two builds of the same app side by side, one disposable and one you actually work in, means constantly answering \"which one is this?\" — and getting it wrong means testing in the window holding your live sessions.",
    how:
      "A badge in the tab row names the slot. Clicking it copies the build details. The About dialog carries the commit and build time, and when a newer build has been staged a banner says so, names it, and offers to promote it.",

    ],
  },

  "distinct-identity": {
    problem:
      "Windows runs one instance per app identity. The disposable test build shared an identity with the live one, so launching it silently handed off to the live window — you thought you were testing, and you were running the other build's code in the window holding your real work.",
    how:
      "Each slot has its own package identity, so its window class and single-instance mutex differ. The disposable build opens as itself, beside the live one.",
    notes: [
      "Two accepted limits: the test slot declares fewer COM registrations, so no default-terminal handoff or Explorer verb; and its <code>wt.exe</code> path resolution points somewhere that doesn't exist, because that check matches the dev identity by name.",
    ],
  },

  "auto-promote": {
    problem:
      "Installing a staged build means closing the window it would replace. Doing that blind can discard live sessions; asking every single time, even when the window is empty, is friction for nothing.",
    how:
      "A read-only check inspects what is actually running under the production build. It allows an unattended promote in exactly two cases: nothing running at all, or a single window with a single pane whose foreground process is a session multiplexer — where the work lives in the multiplexer's own server and survives the window closing. Anything else, including anything ambiguous, fails closed and asks.",
    notes: [
      "An empty slot is treated as the case needing the <em>most</em> care, not the least: nothing fails, nothing warns, and the next launch silently runs whatever was written there.",
    ],
  },

  "ci-poll": {
    problem:
      "Finding out that a new build exists meant remembering to go and look.",
    how:
      "A scheduled task fetches the newest successful build and stages it, so the update offer appears on its own. Staging is automatic; installing stays a deliberate action.",
    settings: [
      { key: "ciPollIntervalMinutes", def: "15", note: "How often to check. 0 never checks." },
    ],
    notes: [
      "The check runs genuinely hidden. On a machine where Windows Terminal is the default terminal host, a hidden console process still gets a Terminal window created for it before the hide request applies — so these launches go through a wrapper that avoids that handoff entirely.",
    ],
  },

  "ci-tests": {
    problem:
      "Builds were made on the developer machine. A warm build tree runs to tens of gigabytes, every worktree pays for its own copy, and nothing verified a build except opening it.",
    how:
      "CI restores, builds, runs the unit suites that pass cleanly, packages both slots, and uploads them as one artifact. A fetch script stages both halves locally. The same deploy script produces the payload in CI as on a developer machine, so the two paths cannot drift.",
    notes: [
      "Green means it compiled, packaged and passed those two suites — not that any behaviour was confirmed. Anything involving the UI still needs a run in the disposable slot.",
    ],
  },
