#                          restart it as often as you like.
#   Dev slot  (wtd.exe) -- where real work happens. NOT touched here. Its
#                          payload is staged so the running Dev instance can
#                          offer to promote it when you have no active
#                          sessions, which is the only moment it is safe to

#
# Both packages are produced from the SAME compiled binaries: Branding.targets
# maps an unrecognised branding to WT_BRANDING_DEV, so a Test build differs from
# a Dev build only in its manifest. What you verify in wtt is byte-for-byte the
# code that gets promoted into wtd.
#
# That is a property this repo has to actively maintain, not one it gets for
# free. The two packaging passes below pass WindowsTerminalBranding on the
# command line, which makes it a GLOBAL property, and MSBuild forwards global
# properties to every ProjectReference -- so each pass genuinely recompiles the
# C++ into the shared bin\ directory. Any build file that special-cases the
# branding therefore has to list 'Test' wherever it lists 'Dev', or the two
# passes quietly produce different binaries. It has happened: src\
# common.build.post.props and src\host\proxy\Host.Proxy.vcxproj both omitted
# 'Test' and the staged exes differed by 2,560 bytes. The check below is cheap;
# run it if you touch anything branding-conditional.
