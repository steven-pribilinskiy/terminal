# Finds -- and optionally clears -- "zombie" Terminal processes: a WindowsTerminal.exe
# that is alive and holding a slot's single-instance identity while owning no window
# at all.
#
# Why this is worth a script of its own: the emperor owns the single-instance identity
# for its package (the window class and mutex mix in the package family name, see
# WindowEmperor::HandleCommandlineArgs). A process sitting there with zero windows
# still answers for the whole app -- every later wtd/wtt launch finds it, hands its
# commandline over via WM_COPYDATA and exits. The visible symptom is the worst kind:
# the Terminal simply stops opening. No window, no error, no crash, no event log
# entry, and Get-Process still shows a healthy process. It stays that way until
# someone kills it by hand.
#
# WindowEmperor::_armNoWindowWatchdog() makes the app quit itself when this happens,
# so a build carrying that fix cannot produce a lasting zombie. This script is the
# out-of-process backstop: it covers slots still running an older payload, and it is
# the fastest way to confirm the diagnosis.
#
# Detection deliberately does NOT use Process.MainWindowHandle. That property only
# finds a *visible* top-level window, so a Terminal legitimately minimised to the
# notification area reads as 0 and would be killed as a false positive. Counting
# every top-level window owned by the process -- hidden ones included -- is the
# distinction that actually matters: "a window exists but you cannot see it" is fine,
# "no window exists" is the zombie.
#
# Reports by default and changes nothing. -Force clears the Test slot; the Dev slot
# additionally needs -IncludeDev, because a windowless Dev process can still hold a
# live shell you cannot reach, and per CLAUDE.md that is your call, not a script's.
