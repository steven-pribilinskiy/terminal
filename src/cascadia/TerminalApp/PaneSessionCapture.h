// Working out what a pane is ACTUALLY running right now -- with its flags --
// and what command would bring that back on the next start.
//
// Nothing upstream tracks this. TerminalPaneContent::GetNewTerminalArgs
// persists the commandline a pane was LAUNCHED with, so a pane sitting in
// `claude --resume <id>` comes back as a bare shell. This module answers the
// other question, and its output rides along in the same persisted layout.
//
// Two detection paths, because a pane's real work may not be a Windows
// process at all:
//
//   Native  - walk the Windows process tree down from the pane's own client
//             process and read the deepest descendant's command line out of
//             its PEB.
//   WSL     - ONE `wsl.exe` call per distro (never per pane) running a probe
//             script that reports every process carrying a WT_SESSION, its
//             foreground process group, argv, cwd, and any agent session
//             directory it holds open.
//
// The WSL path works because ConptyConnection gives every connection its own
// WT_SESSION guid AND appends it to WSLENV (ConptyConnection.cpp:61-94), so
// the value crosses into the distro and the shell for a given pane can be
// identified exactly. That is what makes three panes each running shefrd
// distinguishable; matching on process names alone cannot do it.
//
// Everything here is blocking -- a process snapshot, and a child process
// launch for WSL. Call it from a background thread; TerminalPage::
// _CaptureResumeCommands does.
