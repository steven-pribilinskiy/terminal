description: Diagnose crashes and silent UI failures in this Windows Terminal fork (WinUI 2 / XAML Islands, C++). Use when a build fail-fasts with 0xc000027b or 0xc0000409, when tabs or controls vanish with no crash, when a re-templated control does not render, when a settings page comes up blank, or before theorising about any XAML lifetime, resource-lookup or automation problem. Covers capturing a symbol-resolved first-chance stack with cdb, verifying UI with UI Automation instead of screenshots, and the MUX/UWP traps this repo has already paid for.

# Diagnosing this fork

Builds happen in CI and cost ~40 minutes each, so a wrong theory is expensive
and a captured fact is cheap. This skill exists because on 2026-09-08 the same
bug was "fixed" four times by reasoning about XAML from the outside; every cycle
that captured something took one round, and every cycle that guessed took one
and taught nothing.

## Rule zero: capture, don't reason

**A XAML failure in this app almost never fails where you can see it.** The
throw is caught, or it lands a tick later during render, or it is swallowed by a
guard that exists for good reasons. Symptoms lie:

| What you see | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| Fail-fast `0xc000027b`, no frame of ours on the stack | Something threw during **measure/render** on a later tick. `CCoreServices::NWDrawTree` → `CLayoutManager::UpdateLayout`. |
| Controls silently disappear, no crash | An exception **was** thrown and **was** caught — by `_ApplyTabPosition`'s guard, a `CATCH_LOG`, or C++/WinRT's boundary. |
| "It renders nothing" from a screenshot | `PrintWindow` cannot capture DirectComposition content in XAML Islands. It is a capture artifact, not a rendering failure. |
| A screenshot and a UIA snapshot disagree | Believe **UIA for XAML** (the Settings UI, dialogs, cards) and the **screenshot for the terminal surface and the tab strip**. They fail in opposite directions, which is why "just take a screenshot" is not a rule you can apply blind: a Settings dialog that is open, sized and populated photographs as an ordinary terminal window, while a vertical tab strip that is drawn perfectly reports zero `TabItem`s. Both have happened here. Check the one that can see the layer you are asking about. |

So: get the first-chance stack before forming a theory. `scripts/Capture-FirstChance.ps1`
does the whole thing.

```powershell
# Stage the PDBs for the build under test first - without them every frame of
# ours decodes to TerminalApp!DllGetActivationFactory+<offset> and names nothing.
.\tools\Fetch-CIBuild.ps1 -RunId <id> -WithSymbols
.\tools\Refresh-TestSlot.ps1 -NoLaunch

.\.claude\skills\terminal-fork-diagnostics\scripts\Capture-FirstChance.ps1 `
    -Setting tabPosition -From top -To left
```

It launches `wtt` in the `-From` state, attaches cdb, flips the setting in
`settings.json` (which hot-reloads: `AppLogic::_RegisterSettingsChange` watches
the folder), and logs every first-chance throw with a stack.

### Reading the log

The gold is not the stack, it is the WIL line just after it:

```
D:\a\terminal\terminal\src\cascadia\TerminalApp\TerminalPage.cpp(715)\TerminalApp.dll!...:
  LogHr(2) tid(107e8) 802B000A
  Msg:[winrt::hresult_error: Cannot find a Resource with the Name/Key TabViewButtonStyle]
```

That is **file, line, HRESULT and message** — the entire diagnosis in one line.
Grep for `LogHr|ReturnHr|Msg:\[` first and only read stacks if those are absent.

| HRESULT | In this codebase it has meant |
|---|---|
| `0x802B000A` | A `{ThemeResource}`/`{StaticResource}` key a template cannot see. |
| `0x8000FFFF` | Adding a XAML element that **already has a parent**. |
| `0x80004005` | Generic `hresult_error` re-thrown at a WIL boundary; look further in. |
| `0xc0000409` | `__fastfail` - a stowed exception that nothing caught. |

### Make the next failure measure itself

When a fix might not work, ship the fix **and** a log line that states the
outcome in numbers. `restored 0 of 1 tabs` turned a third guess into a
one-cycle answer. A silent failure is the bug's best defence; take it away.

## Verify with UI Automation, not screenshots

`scripts/Get-UiaSnapshot.ps1` reports control types, names and bounding
rectangles for the Test slot's window. Geometry is proof; a screenshot is not:

```powershell
# Requires Windows PowerShell 5.1 - UIAutomationClient is not in pwsh 7.
powershell.exe -NoProfile -File .\.claude\skills\terminal-fork-diagnostics\scripts\Get-UiaSnapshot.ps1
```

Counting `TabItem` before and after an action is how the vanishing-tabs bug was
pinned down, and how each attempted fix was scored (`1,0,0,0,0`).

**Two traps in the tooling itself.** UIA `Invoke()` on a `SettingsCard` silently
does nothing - `SettingsCardAutomationPeer` advertises the Invoke pattern but
`ButtonBaseAutomationPeer` supplies no `IInvokeProvider`, so an automated click
on a settings card proves nothing either way. And `FindFirst` by name alone will
happily return a `Text` element that shares the name with the `Button` you
wanted; always pair the name with a `ControlType`.

To open the Settings UI without touching the keyboard, post the system-menu
command (`WM_SYSCOMMAND`, id `4096`) rather than synthesising `Ctrl+,`.

## Traps this repo has already paid for

**MUX's Generic.xaml helper styles are `x:Name`, not `x:Key`.**
`TabViewButtonStyle` and `TabViewScrollViewerStyle` resolve inside MUX's own
dictionary and nowhere else. A copy of a MUX template living in an app
dictionary cannot reference them - the lookup throws `0x802B000A` part-way
through expanding the template. Copy the *markup* you need, never the key.

**A half-expanded ControlTemplate kills the window one tick later.** If template
expansion throws, the control keeps the broken visual tree; XAML fails on the
next measure with no catchable frame. Whenever a template is applied inside a
`try`, the `catch` must `ClearValue(FrameworkElement::StyleProperty())` so a bad
template degrades instead of fail-fasting.

**An explicit `Style` does NOT remove a control's default template.** UWP applies
the built-in style from `DefaultStyleKey` underneath `FrameworkElement::Style`,
so a `Style` with no `Template` setter layers onto it. Proof in this repo:
`App.xaml`'s implicit `primitives:TabViewListView` style sets only
`ItemContainerTransitions`, and `ColorButtonStyle` is applied by key to the
colour-picker buttons - neither sets a `Template` and both render. Do not "fix"
a missing-template theory without checking this first.

**`TabView.TabItems` holds live `TabViewItem` elements, not data.**
`TabManagement.cpp` inserts them directly. Consequences:
- Re-templating the `TabView` builds a new list, and elements that still have a
  parent never arrive in it - the strip empties and stays empty.
- Neither `Clear()` nor a following `UpdateLayout()` unparents them. The panel
  still holding them belongs to a template that no longer exists, so nothing
  will ever release it on its own; remove the child from its parent `Panel`'s
  `Children` explicitly.
- Do not re-template at all. This is settled: `TerminalPage::_SetTabStripOrientation`
  flips `ItemsStackPanel::Orientation` on the panel `ItemsControl::ItemsPanelRoot()`
  returns, which is one DependencyProperty on an object that already exists, so
  no container is regenerated and `TabItems` is never touched. Five attempts to
  make the swap survive all failed; the sixth deleted it.
- What the stock template forces, once you stop replacing it: `TabContainerGrid`
  is four **columns** (`LeftContentColumn | TabColumn | AddButtonColumn |
  RightContentColumn`) and the footer's is the `*` one, so in a narrow strip the
  footer sits right of the tabs and eats the width. Do not rewrite those
  `ColumnDefinition`s - MUX's compiled `UpdateTabWidths` holds references to all
  four and writes to them. Borrow the content out into a grid you own instead
  (`TabStripFooter(nullptr)` first - one parent per element), and give the list
  an explicit `Width` so the `Auto` column measures to the strip.

**You cannot read MUX's stock templates here.** Builds are CI-only and the local
`packages\` tree is deleted, so `microsoft.ui.xaml\*\Generic.xaml` is not on disk
and is not in the NuGet cache either. Work from template *part names* via
`GetTemplateChild` and from the projection headers below, not from the markup.

**`GetTotalNonClientExclusiveSize().height` includes the titlebar** for
`NonClientIslandWindow`. Using it as a window height overhangs the work area by
a whole titlebar, which is how a docked window ended up on top of the taskbar.
For anything that should sit inside the work area, add only the invisible resize
border - the same thickness on every side, already halved elsewhere to compute
`left`.

**`Grid::SetRow`/`SetColumn`/`SetRowSpan`/`SetColumnSpan` take a
`FrameworkElement`,** while `Grid::Children().Append` takes a `UIElement`. A
`try_as<UIElement>` on something you are about to position is a compile error
one CI round away.

**A `SettingsCard` cannot be invoked over UI Automation, so it cannot be clicked
by script.** `SettingsCardAutomationPeer` derives from `ButtonBaseAutomationPeerT`,
which supplies no `IInvokeProvider`, and `ButtonBase`'s entire public surface is
`ClickMode`, `IsPointerOver`, `IsPressed`, `Command`, `CommandParameter` and
`Click` as add/remove only - there is no way to raise `Click` from outside. Every
card in the editor is wired to `Click`. To drive one, take its bounding rectangle
from `Get-UiaSnapshot.ps1` and click the centre with `AgentDriver.exe`, honouring
the idle rules in the global `CLAUDE.md`.

## Check a WinRT API before spending a build on it

The projected headers under `src/cascadia/TerminalApp/*/Generated Files/winrt/impl/`
are checked in by nobody and deleted by nothing, and they are the authority on
what a type actually exposes. Reading them turns "does this API exist, and is it
settable?" from a 40-minute CI question into a grep. This is how the tab-strip
rework was de-risked before a single build:

```bash
g="src/cascadia/TerminalApp/dll/Generated Files/winrt/impl/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.0.h"
grep -n "ItemsPanelRoot" "$g"                       # -> on IItemsControl2, public getter
awk '/struct consume_.*IItemsStackPanel\b/,/^    };/' "$g" | grep Orientation
                                                    # -> getter AND setter: the flip is legal
```

Two things to read off them, both of which decided a design this session:

- **A property with only a `[[nodiscard]] auto Foo() const;` and no
  `auto Foo(T const&) const;` is read-only.** That is how `ButtonBase` was shown
  to have no way to raise `Click`, which killed an entire planned fix.
- **Which interface a member lives on** tells you what to `try_as` to. `consume_*`
  struct names map one-to-one onto the interfaces.

If the headers are absent (a fresh clone that has never built), the same answers
are in the Windows SDK metadata - but do not guess, and do not "just try it" when
trying it costs a CI cycle.

## Preventing a crash beats diagnosing one

Three layers, and they do different jobs. Reach for the first that applies.

**1. Make the failure non-fatal, where the failure is a leaf.** A missing label for
one dropdown value should not kill a window. `LocalizedNameForEnumName`
(`TerminalSettingsEditor/Utils.cpp`) now falls back to the enum's own name when the
resource is absent, so the row reads `SettingsUITab` instead of the Settings UI
dying on open. `_ApplyTabPosition`'s try/catch is the same idea one level up: a
layout that throws degrades to a top strip rather than taking the process.

Degrade a **leaf** - one label, one icon, one optional pane. Never degrade
something structural, because a swallowed structural failure is a bug you now
cannot see. And know the limit: **this cannot catch the crashes that hurt most
here.** A half-expanded template fails on the next measure inside
`CCoreServices::NWDrawTree`, and a stowed `0xc000027b` fail-fasts with none of our
frames on the stack. There is no XAML equivalent of a React ErrorBoundary for
those; for them, prevention is the only lever.

**2. Gate it, so it cannot ship.** `Check-SettingsModelConsistency.ps1` exists for
exactly the missing-resource class and **missed one on 2026-09-09**, because it
only recognised `INITIALIZE_BINDABLE_ENUM_SETTING` while the Actions editor calls
`_InitializeEnumListAndValue` directly. Settings died on open in the Dev slot.

The lesson is not "run the gate" - it was run, and it said "No inconsistencies
found". It is that **a gate only covers the shapes it was taught**, so when you add
a new way of doing an old thing, the gate needs teaching too.

**3. Prove the gate bites.** An intermediate version of that same fix matched
nothing and reported success - a check that checks nothing, which is strictly worse
than no check, because it buys false confidence. Whenever you extend one, break the
thing on purpose and confirm it fails:

```bash
# remove the string you just added, run the checker, expect FAIL, restore
cp "$R" "$S/resw.bak" && node -e "…strip the entry…"
pwsh -NoProfile ./tools/Check-SettingsModelConsistency.ps1   # must FAIL
cp "$S/resw.bak" "$R"
```

Watch the count it prints, too (`206 enum dropdown labels`, not `0`) - that number
falling to zero is what a silently-dead check looks like.

## Gates that cost seconds and save a round trip

Run these before pushing anything:

```powershell
.\tools\Check-SettingsModelConsistency.ps1   # missing resw strings, enum labels
.\tools\GenerateSettingsIndex.ps1 -SourceDir .\src\cascadia\TerminalSettingsEditor -OutputDir <scratch>
```

The first matters most: a missing resource string compiles, packages, passes both
test suites, and then access-violates the first time the Settings UI asks for a
name. It also catches an `MTSMSettings.h` entry with no matching
`INHERITABLE_SETTING` in the `.idl` - which compiles and packages and simply does
not work. It earned its keep on `settingsUIHost` while that was being added.

The second is safe to run by hand into a scratch directory (the build runs it
into `Generated Files`). Grep the output for a new card's uid: an entry with an
empty `ElementName` means search will land on the page but never scroll to the
setting, which is the symptom of a missing `x:Name`. Also worth the few seconds - parse what you edited:

```powershell
Get-Content .\src\cascadia\TerminalSettingsModel\defaults.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
[xml](Get-Content .\src\cascadia\TerminalSettingsEditor\Resources\en-US\Resources.resw -Raw)
py -3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/build.yml',encoding='utf-8'))"
```

And check line endings survived every edit, because most sources here are CRLF
and `.gitattributes` normalises nothing:

```bash
cr=$(tr -cd '\r' < "$f" | wc -c); lf=$(tr -cd '\n' < "$f" | wc -c)   # cr==lf means CRLF
```

## Slot rules that apply while debugging

`wtt` is the only slot to launch, attach to, or kill. Identify by executable
path (`C:\TerminalSlots\test\...`) - every Terminal built from this repo shares
the process name, including the one the session is running in. See the repo
`CLAUDE.md`; nothing here overrides it.

Killing cdb while it is attached takes the debuggee with it. Use `.detach` if
the window needs to survive the capture.
