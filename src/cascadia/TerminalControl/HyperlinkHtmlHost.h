Module Name:
- HyperlinkHtmlHost.h

Abstract:
- Hosts an integration's own HTML representation of a hovered link inside the
  hyperlink card, using WebView2. A plugin that returns an "html" key gets a real
  browser rectangle instead of the generic label/value field list, can read the
  step results it produced as window.__data, and can talk back to the card with
  chrome.webview.postMessage({ height }) and ({ open }).

- The whole thing is gated twice over, and both gates are shut today:
  Feature_HyperlinkPreviewHtml is AlwaysDisabled in every branding, and
  WebView2Loader.dll is not shipped in the package. IsAvailable() is therefore
  false in every build, which means TermControl never creates a host and the
  field list renders exactly as it did before this file existed. The code is
  compiled rather than #ifdef'd out on purpose -- a runtime test keeps it honest,
  so it cannot rot between now and the push that ships the loader.

- This is a plain C++ class with no WinRT projection: nothing outside
  TermControl.cpp has any business owning one.
