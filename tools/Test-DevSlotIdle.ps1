# Read-only check for the narrow auto-promote exception in CLAUDE.md ("The two slots").
#
# Answers one question: is it safe to run Promote-DevSlot.ps1 without asking first?
# Safe means either nothing is running under the Dev payload, or exactly one window
# is running with exactly one tab/pane whose foreground process is a session
# multiplexer (shefrd, herdr, tmux, screen, zellij) rather than a raw shell -- in
# which case the actual work lives in the multiplexer's own persistent server, not
# the window, and closing the window loses nothing.
#
# This is a heuristic, not a proof. Process-tree shape is an approximation of tab
# and pane count -- a multiplexer client can fork helper processes that look like
# extra leaves, and correlating a specific WSL pty back to a specific Windows-side
# wsl.exe process is inexact. Ambiguous results MUST be treated as unsafe (exit 1)
# rather than guessed safe: this script fails closed on purpose.
#
# Never closes, kills, or promotes anything itself. It only reports.
