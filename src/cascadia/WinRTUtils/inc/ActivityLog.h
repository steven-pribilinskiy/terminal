// An append-only record of every process this Terminal starts, and every console
// client handed to it, so that "where did that window come from?" has an answer
// after the fact.
//
// Why a file and not ETW: the interesting case is a window that has already
// appeared. ETW keeps nothing unless a trace session was running before the
// event, which is exactly the situation you are not in when something surprises
// you. Upstream's defterm logging (microsoft/terminal#11537) is ETW plus a .wprp
// for that reason and answers a different question -- reproducing a known
// problem, not explaining one that already happened.
//
// Why it lives in WinRTUtils: the spawn sites are spread across projects that do
// not reference each other. TerminalConnection owns the profile launch and the
// defterm handoff, TerminalApp owns the background helpers, ShellExtension runs
// inside Explorer. WinRTUtils is the one library all of them already reference.
//
// Two constraints the implementation has to keep, both learned here rather than
// documented anywhere:
//
//   * Nothing on a launch path may block on disk. Record() formats the line on
//     the caller's thread and returns; the append happens on a threadpool timer.
//     See TerminalPage.SlotPromotion.cpp's "nothing on this path should ever
//     block a window from opening".
//   * The log is shared between processes. Each Terminal window can be its own
//     process, and both slots write to their own package's folder but several
//     windows share one. Appends are therefore done with FILE_APPEND_DATA and a
//     single WriteFile per batch, which the OS places at the end of the file
//     atomically -- no cross-process lock, and no read-modify-write.
